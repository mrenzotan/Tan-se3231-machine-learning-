PRELIMS

1. Why did you choose this dataset?

- I chose this dataset because I myself am a student and plays a lot all the time. I was curios and interested to see if there is a correlation between games and academic grades.

2. What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?

- Firstly, according to the simple linear regression analysis, this suggests that every extra hour spent playing games is associated with an average drop of 1.2 points in grades. However, the low R² value of 0.0431 indicates that gaming hours account for only 4.3% of the variation in grades, implying a very weak connection. The scatter plot further supports this, showing grades scattered widely across different gaming hours.

- On the other hand, according to the multiple linear regression analysis, this reveals that parental education, particularly the mother's, has the strongest positive impact on academic performance. While playing games frequently shows a slight positive correlation with grades, playing a variety of different games is linked to lower academic performance. The multiple regression model explains about 26% of grade variation, an improvement from the simple model but still leaving 74% unexplained. The scatter plot highlights the model’s prediction errors, reinforcing the moderate R² value. Overall, these findings suggest that while excessive gaming, especially playing multiple games, may negatively affect grades, parental education plays a more significant role. The relationship between gaming and academic performance is complex and influenced by multiple factors beyond just playtime.

3. How relevant is linear regression today?

- Linear regression remains relevant today for analyzing relationships and making predictions in fields like finance, healthcare, and marketing. While it has limitations, such as assuming a straight-line relationship, its simplicity and efficiency keep it widely used. Despite advanced alternatives, it remains a valuable tool for data analysis.

MIDTERMS

1. Does preprocessing affect the result of the model? Why?

- Yes, preprocessing significantly affects the result of the model because handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features ensure that the data is clean and suitable for algorithms like KMeans, which are sensitive to feature scales and data quality.

2. What is your conclusion based on the interpretation or result of your model?

- Based on the results, the KMeans clustering was able to group the houses into distinct clusters, which can help identify patterns or segments in the housing market; however, since clustering is unsupervised, further analysis is needed to interpret the meaning and usefulness of each cluster for decision-making.
